# Yoguha

A Flutter project made with Firebase that helps you for your next Yoga sessions.  
It contains :  
- [x] An authentication system  
- [x] A timer  
- [x] Some relaxing playlists  
- [ ] A profile page  

## How to install it
Here is the link to download the APK (android) file.  
*(The app doesn't support iOS because Apple is a really big piece of shit and don't allow us to do anything if we don't have a mac.)*
